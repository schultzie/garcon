## Garcon

This is a Slack bot that is written in Javascript to listen for keywords in a Slack channel and to output a knowledge base article.

This was my first app in Javascript. 

I used Tim Stewart's Techno Boto as a kicking off point to build the app. 

Assembled by Greg Schultz

## Getting started

Goto coins.js and place your oauth token for your slack app in the SLACK_OAUTH_TOKEN const string. 

The bot will reply to messages that you key on in any channel it is invited to. 

Please use this however you would like. I hope this helps a few people. :) 

## Thanks

Thank you to Tim Stewart, stackoverflow users, github users, youtube people, and irc folks for any and all help provided.
